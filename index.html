            <p>Hi, I'm Andrew Beery, a passionate and driven Information Science and Data Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a certificate in Digital Media Analytics. I have a deep interest in leveraging data and technology to solve real-world problems, and my academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>I serve as the VP of Information Systems at the Wisconsin Hoofers, one of the largest university outdoor recreation organizations in the country, where I manage the technology infrastructure and ensure smooth operations for over 2,500 members. I am also a team captain of the Wisconsin Alpine Ski and Snowboard Team, where I collaborate with others to foster team growth and success.</p>
            <p>Also, I am very experienced in the world of bicycles as I have worked the past six years in various roles of a bike shop from mechanic to sales manager to data science intern.</p>
            <p>My technical expertise includes Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Docker, and I am very interested in Data Managment, Data Analytics, and especially Natural Language Processing. I am constantly looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and grow professionally.</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating, or if you'd just like to chat about data science, technology, or outdoor adventures!</p>
